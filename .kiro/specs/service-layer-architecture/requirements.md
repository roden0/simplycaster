# Requirements Document

## Introduction

### Goals and principles
Separation of concerns: Keep business logic independent from data access and infrastructure concerns.
Testability: Business logic should be unit-testable without a database or external systems.
Maintainability: Clear boundaries, consistent patterns, and minimal duplication.
Domain-driven: Entities and value objects express business rules and invariants; use cases orchestrate behavior.
Explicit contracts: Interfaces and DTOs define inputs/outputs and persistence boundaries.

### Scope
Domain layer: Entities, value objects, domain services, aggregates.
Application layer: Use cases (application services), DTOs, orchestration, transaction boundary.
Infrastructure layer: Repository implementations, data sources, external adapters, mapping, cross-cutting concerns.
Testing: Unit, integration, contract tests, Object Mother/Test Data Builder.

## Glossary

- **Service Layer**: The architectural layer that contains business logic and orchestrates data operations
- **Repository Pattern**: An abstraction layer that encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for data operations
- **Use Case**: A business operation that represents a specific user interaction or system behavior
- **Infrastructure Layer**: The technical implementation layer that handles external concerns like database connections, file systems, and third-party services
- **Domain Layer**: The core business logic layer that contains entities and business rules
- **SimplyCaster System**: The podcast recording and management platform
- **Data Access Layer**: The layer responsible for database operations and data persistence

## Requirements


### Layered architecture boundaries
Requirement: Organize code into clear layers (Domain, Application, Infrastructure), with dependencies pointing inward (Infrastructure → Application → Domain).
- Acceptance criteria:
Application layer has no compile-time dependency on concrete infrastructure types (only interfaces).
Domain layer has no dependency on Application or Infrastructure.
Unit tests for use cases run without starting a database or network services.
Cyclic dependencies between layers are disallowed by build tooling/lint rules.

### Use cases as application services
Requirement: Implement business operations as use case classes/functions with explicit input/output models.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each use case exposes a single main method (e.g., execute/handle) receiving a request DTO and returning a response DTO or result type.
Use cases orchestrate domain rules and call repositories through interfaces; no direct SQL/ORM logic in use cases.
Side effects (email, messaging, files) are performed via injected ports/adapters.
Use cases are stateless; any state is passed through parameters.

### Entities and value objects (DDD)
Requirement: Model core business concepts with entities (identity) and value objects (immutable, identity by values).
- Acceptance criteria:
Entities have a stable identity field; equality uses identity.
Value objects are immutable; equality uses all constituent fields; invariants enforced at construction.
Business invariants are enforced inside domain types, not in controllers or repositories.
Changes to entity state occur through domain methods that validate rules (not public field mutation).

### Aggregates and consistency boundaries
Requirement: Define aggregates to enforce invariants and transactional consistency within their boundary.
- Acceptance criteria:
Repositories expose aggregate roots only; child entities are loaded through the aggregate root.
Modifications across multiple aggregates use domain/application services and are eventually consistent or coordinated by a saga/process manager when needed.
No cross-aggregate invariants enforced synchronously without a transaction strategy.

### Repository abstraction
Requirement: Access persistence via repository interfaces in the application/domain layers with infrastructure implementations.
- Acceptance criteria:
For each aggregate root, there is a repository interface with methods like getById, save, delete, and query abstractions.
No persistence-specific APIs (ORM types, SQL) leak into domain or application code.
Repositories return domain entities/value objects; mapping to persistence models occurs in infrastructure.

### Unit of Work and transaction management
Requirement: Use a Unit of Work/transaction boundary encapsulated at the use case level.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each use case delineates transactional scope; either explicit UoW API or framework-provided transaction wrapper.
Either all repository operations in a use case commit atomically or roll back on failure.
Long-running operations or external calls are outside transactions or use outbox/transactional messaging.

### Input validation
Requirement: Validate incoming DTOs and construct domain objects that enforce invariants.
- Acceptance criteria:
External input is validated separately (format, presence, authorization).
Domain validation occurs when creating/updating domain objects; invalid states cannot be instantiated.
Validation errors are mapped to well-defined error types/codes; no generic runtime exceptions exposed to callers.

### Error handling and exception mapping
Requirement: Standardize domain and infrastructure error handling.
- Acceptance criteria:
Domain errors use explicit types (e.g., DomainError) returned or thrown by use cases.
Infrastructure/IO errors are caught in application layer and mapped to application-level errors; sensitive details are not exposed.
Global error codes and messages are documented for use case responses.

### DTOs and mapping
Requirement: Separate transport DTOs from domain models; use mappers.
- Acceptance criteria:
Controllers/adapters only receive/send DTOs; mapping happens in application/infrastructure.
No direct exposure of domain entities on external boundaries.
Mapping utilities are unit-tested and do not contain business rules.

### DRY and shared components
Requirement: Avoid duplication by centralizing cross-cutting utilities, base types, and common patterns.
- Acceptance criteria:
Shared utilities (e.g., pagination, sorting, currency types, date/time) live in a shared module without circular dependencies.
Common error structures, result types, and base repository contracts are reused across features.
Duplicated validation or mapping logic is refactored into shared helpers.

### CQRS alignment (optional)
Requirement: Consider separating commands and queries for complex domains.
- Acceptance criteria:
Commands mutate state and return minimal results; queries are read-only and optimized for read models.
Query services do not depend on domain aggregates if projections/read models suffice.
If CQRS is adopted, clear boundaries and documentation exist; otherwise, keep unified service layer with simple reads/writes.

### Dependency injection and configuration
Requirement: Use DI to wire use cases, repositories, and adapters; keep configs externalized.
- Acceptance criteria:
All collaborators of a use case are injected; no service locator or static singletons.
Config values (DB URLs, API keys) are provided via environment/config files, not hard-coded.
DI container configuration resides in composition root within Infrastructure.

### Logging and observability
Requirement: Instrument use cases and key domain operations with structured logs and traces.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each use case logs start/end, correlation ID, and key decision points (without sensitive data).
Errors include contextual metadata and are traceable end-to-end.
Metrics exist for latency, throughput, and error rates per use case.

### Caching strategy
Requirement: Introduce caching where appropriate without violating domain consistency.
- Acceptance criteria:
Caching occurs behind repository/query interfaces; application/domain code is unaware of cache presence.
Cache invalidation is defined per entity/aggregate; stale reads are acceptable only where business allows.
No cache keys leak domain secrets; TTLs documented.

### Security and authorization
Requirement: Enforce authorization and input security at the application boundary.
- Acceptance criteria:
Use cases verify caller permissions via an injected authorization service; no direct checks in domain entities.
Sensitive fields are redacted in logs and DTOs; PII handling follows policy.
External calls use secure channels; secrets are managed via the configuration system.

### Performance and pagination
Requirement: Standardize pagination, filtering, and sorting patterns.
- Acceptance criteria:
Query interfaces support pagination with stable ordering and deterministic results.
N+1 query risks are mitigated in repository implementations; performance tests exist for heavy flows.
Large list queries have upper limits and default page sizes.

### Concurrency and idempotency
Requirement: Handle concurrent updates and support idempotent commands where needed.
- Acceptance criteria:
Optimistic concurrency tokens (version) are used on aggregates; conflicts are detected and reported.
Idempotency keys can be provided to command use cases; repeated execution yields the same result.
Critical sections avoid double-spend or duplicate effects via transactional design/outbox.

### Documentation and contracts
Requirement: Document use cases, domain models, and interfaces.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each use case has a concise spec with intent, inputs, outputs, invariants, and error cases.
Repository interfaces are documented with consistency guarantees and performance notes.
Architecture decision records (ADRs) exist for key choices (e.g., CQRS, outbox).

### Folder/module structure
Requirement: Adopt a consistent, discoverable structure.
- Acceptance criteria:
Top-level modules: domain/, application/, infrastructure/, tests/, shared/.
Each bounded context has its own substructure under domain and application.
No cross-context imports except via shared kernel abstractions.

### Code quality and linting
Requirement: Enforce standards with linters, formatters, and static analysis.
- Acceptance criteria:
Build pipeline fails on style violations and risky dependencies (e.g., infrastructure type imported in domain).
Mandatory code reviews ensure adherence to patterns.
Cyclomatic complexity limits for use cases and domain services defined and enforced.

## Testing requirements

### Testing strategy and coverage
Requirement: Layered test suite: unit, integration, contract, and acceptance tests.
- Acceptance criteria:
Unit tests cover use cases, domain entities/value objects, and mappers with >80% line coverage and meaningful branch coverage.
Integration tests cover repository implementations against a real or ephemeral DB.
Acceptance tests verify end-to-end flows through adapters with realistic fixtures.

### Object Mother and Test Data Builder
Requirement: Provide Object Mother utilities per entity to create valid and variant instances for tests.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each entity has an Object Mother with defaults for valid instances and methods for common variations and invalid states.
Test Data Builders allow fluent overrides of fields; builders are immutable and chainable.
Object Mothers live under tests/support and are reused across unit and integration tests.

### Repository contract tests
Requirement: Define shared contract tests to validate any repository implementation.
- Acceptance criteria:
A suite of contract tests targets the repository interface (save/get/delete, concurrency behavior, transactions).
Both in-memory and database-backed implementations must pass the same contract suite.
Performance baseline tests exist (e.g., retrieval under pagination).

### Use case tests (unit)
Requirement: Unit-test use cases with mocked repositories/adapters.
- Acceptance criteria:
Each use case has tests for success, validation errors, domain rule violations, and infrastructure errors mapped to application errors.
No database/network in unit tests; dependencies mocked via interfaces.
Idempotency and concurrency scenarios are covered where applicable.

### Domain model tests
Requirement: Test invariants and behaviors of entities/value objects thoroughly.
- Acceptance criteria:
Constructors/factories for value objects reject invalid states with explicit errors.
Entity methods enforce invariants; attempting invalid transitions is covered by tests.
Equality, hashing, and serialization for value objects are verified.

### Integration tests for adapters
Requirement: Test infrastructure adapters (repositories, external services) with real dependencies.
- Acceptance criteria:
Repository tests run against an ephemeral or containerized DB and verify transactions, isolation, and mappings.
External API adapters use sandbox/stubs with realistic responses; retries and timeouts are tested.
Data mapping between domain and persistence models is verified end-to-end.

### Test data management
Requirement: Manage fixtures deterministically and minimize coupling.
- Acceptance criteria:
Object Mothers and Builders produce deterministic defaults; randomization only when controlled and seeded.
Database fixtures are seeded/reset per test suite with transaction rollback or clean setup/teardown.
Avoid shared mutable fixtures across tests.

### Test naming, structure, and readability
Requirement: Maintain clear, behavior-focused test names and organization.
- Acceptance criteria:
Tests follow Given-When-Then naming; files mirror production structure.
One assertion per behavior where possible; avoid over-specified tests.
Common test helpers (e.g., time freezing, id generator fakes) exist and are documented.

### CI integration and quality gates
Requirement: Integrate tests and checks into CI with clear gates.
- Acceptance criteria:
CI runs unit, contract, and integration tests with artifacts (coverage reports, logs).
Merge blocked on coverage thresholds, linting, and contract suites passing.
Flaky test detection and quarantine process documented.

### Non-functional test considerations
Requirement: Include performance, load, and resilience tests for critical flows.
- Acceptance criteria:
Baseline performance tests exist for high-volume use cases; thresholds documented.
Resilience tests cover retries, circuit breaking, and backoff behavior.
Chaos or failure injection for critical adapters is possible in a safe environment.
